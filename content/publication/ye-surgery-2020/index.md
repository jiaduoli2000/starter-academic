abstract: "BACKGROUND: Thymic carcinoma is a type of rare and highly malignant tumor. Limited information was available on prognostic factors of late-stage thymic carcinoma. The  aim of this study was to identify factors that impact prognosis and to define the  relationship between survival and surgical intervention in patients with Masaoka  stage IV thymic carcinoma. METHODS: From 1973 to 2015, a total of 311 consecutive  patients were enrolled in this study with pathologic confirmed Masaoka stage IV  thymic carcinoma from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database.  Kaplan-Meier analyses, Cox-regression analyses and propensity score matching (PSM)  were performed to evaluate prognosis. RESULTS: In the multivariate analysis, larger  tumor size, distant metastasis and positive lymph node status were associated with  poorer outcome. After PSM, no receipt of surgery was the prognostic factor  indicating poorer survival [hazard ratio (HR) 1.985, 95% confidence interval (CI)  1.007-3.913, P=0.048 for overall survival (OS); HR 1.649, 95% CI: 1.009-2.697,  P=0.046 for disease-specific survival (DSS)]. Subgroup analysis indicated that  significantly improved survival with surgery was observed in patients who were textless60  years (HR 0.48, 95% CI: 0.32-0.72), female (HR 0.37, 95% CI: 0.23-0.60), Caucasian  (HR 0.56, 95% CI: 0.40-0.77), with larger tumor size (â‰¥7.0 cm, HR 0.42, 95% CI:  0.25-0.69), with (HR 0.60, 95% CI: 0.39-0.90) or without distant metastasis (HR  0.46, 95% CI: 0.26-0.83), and node-positive (HR 0.56, 95% CI: 0.38-0.82).  CONCLUSIONS: Surgical treatment could be beneficial in patients with Masaoka stage  IV thymic carcinoma. This SEER based analysis revealed the role of surgical  resection and the favorable effect of surgery in specific thymic carcinoma  subgroups."
