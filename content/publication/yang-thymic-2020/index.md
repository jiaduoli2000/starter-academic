abstract: "OBJECTIVES: Thymic squamous cell carcinoma (TSCC) is a rare neoplasm that has been sparsely cited in the literature. The aim of this study was to determine disease  characteristics and prognostic factors of patients in a Surveillance, Epidemiology,  and End Results (SEER) analysis. METHODS: Cases from 1990-2016 were retrieved from  the SEER database and demographics, treatments, and survival outcomes were analyzed.  RESULTS: The TSCC accounted for 72.4% of the thymic carcinomas and 7.2% of thymic  tumors. The 276 patients (165 men) selected for analysis had a median age of 65  (24-85) years, and 201 patients were diagnosed with Masaoka-Koga stage III/IV. The  median survival of TSCC was 59 months with a 49.0% 5-year OS rate, a better  prognosis than lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma (32.1%) and undifferentiated  carcinoma (33.3%). Multivariate analysis revealed the Masaoka-Koga stage (p = 0.003)  and surgical types (complete resection, incomplete resection, and none; p textless 0.001)  were determinants of survival. Complete resection had the best prognosis with a  72.7% 5-year OS rate. Chemotherapy was an independent protective factor (HR = 0.555,  95% CI 0.347-0.886; p = 0.014) though poor survival was showed in univariate  analysis. And the survival benefit of chemotherapy was validated in PSM analysis  (3-year OS rate was 77.7% with chemotherapy vs. 52.8% without chemotherapy; p =  0.014). CONCLUSIONS: TSCC was frequently diagnosed in older patients with advanced  Masaoka-Koga stage and had more favorable survival than other subtypes of thymic  carcinomas. Complete resection is the preferred treatment. Masaoka-Koga stage and  chemotherapy had a strong association with prognosis."
