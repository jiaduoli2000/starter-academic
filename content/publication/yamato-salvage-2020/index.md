abstract: "BACKGROUND: Although complete surgical resection of thymic carcinoma is a prognostic factor, extended surgery combined with a major blood vessel procedure remains  controversial because of the increased risk of mortality. We report a case of Stage  IVa thymic carcinoma successfully resected with a pneumonectomy along with aortic  arch replacement after chemotherapy. CASE PRESENTATION: A 45-year-old male was  diagnosed with thymic carcinoma invasion to the aortic arch and left pulmonary  artery. Malignant pericardial effusion was also noted, though disappeared after  chemotherapy, thus surgical options were considered. A radical resection procedure  including left pneumonectomy, aortic arch replacement with total rerouting of the  supra-arch vessels, and right pulmonary artery plication was performed. The  postoperative course was uneventful and the patient has been disease-free for  3â€‰years. CONCLUSION: Extended salvage surgery might be a valuable option for  advanced thymic carcinoma."
