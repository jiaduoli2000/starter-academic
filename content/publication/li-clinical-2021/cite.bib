 abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To describe clinical features and long-term prognosis in patients with Good Syndrome (GS). METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed medical records of GS  patients at Peking Union Medical College Hospital from January 2001 to May 2019.  Data regarding clinical manifestations and treatments were collected. Patients were  routinely followed-up via clinical and telephone interviews, and survival analysis  was performed with Kaplan-Meier analysis. RESULTS: Twenty-four patients were  identified, including 8 males and 16 females, with a median age at diagnosis of 58  years (IQR 52-62 years). Twelve patients (50.0%) had autoimmune manifestations.  Multi-organ involvements included musculoskeletal (37.5%), respiratory (33.3%),  gastrointestinal (29.2%), hematologic (29.2%) systems, et.al. Infections were  detected in 23 (95.8%) patients, mostly located in lung (69.6%), blood (26.1%) and  gastrointestinal tract (21.7%). Thymectomy was performed in 23 patients, with the  most common histology of type AB (10, 47.6%). Twenty-one patients were consecutively  followed-up with a median follow-up of 84 (IQR, 48-116) months, and 11 (52.4%) died,  mainly due to infection (8/11, 72.7%). The 5-year and 10-year survival rates were  90.0% (95% CI, 77.8%-100%) and 38.5% (95% CI, 19.6%-75.5%), respectively.  CONCLUSIONS: GS patients tended to present with various infections and autoimmune  manifestations. The 10-year survival rate from the Chinese population was poor,  mainly due to infections.},
