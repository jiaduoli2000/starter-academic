 abstract = {This report presents the case of a 68-year-old female patient previously diagnosed with thymoma by her local doctor. She was referred to our hospital for surgery, and  the thymoma was removed and diagnosed as a World Health Organization (WHO)  classification type AB thymoma. After surgery, she experienced general malaise, a  loss of appetite, and weight loss, so she visited our hospital in May 2019. A blood  test showed hypogammaglobulinemia and low B lymphocytes. A bone marrow examination  revealed no morphological abnormalities. Flow cytometric analysis indicated a marked  decrease in both the B cell-related surface markers CD19 and CD20 and the T  cell-related surface marker CD4, and the CD4/CD8 ratio was also low. She was  diagnosed with Good's syndrome, and immunoglobulin replacement therapy was  administered. She subsequently developed hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH)  due to infection and was treated according to the HLH2004 protocol, but she finally  succumbed to multiple organ damage as a result of sepsis. Given that Good's syndrome  is associated with both humoral and cellular immune dysfunctions, affected patients  tend to develop severe infections and have a poor prognosis. In such cases, early  detection, regular immunoglobulin replacement therapy, and infection prevention  therapies are important.},
