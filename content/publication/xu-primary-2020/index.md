abstract: "Objective: To reveal clinical features, pathological diagnosis, treatment and prognosis of primary thymic mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma and  review literatures. Methods: The clinical characteristics, pathological diagnosis,  laboratory texts, treatment and prognosis of 7 cases of primary thymic MALT lymphoma  identified at the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University from  November 2017 to January 2019 were collected and analyzed. Results: Of 7 primary  thymic MALT lymphoma cases, six were female. Patients were often asymptomatic and  were found mediastinal mass by chest CT. After mediastinal mass resection,  pathologist reported a primary thymic MALT lymphoma. Laboratory tests showed all  patients were positive for anti-nuclear antibody, anti-Ro52 antibodies and  anti-Sjogren's syndrome A antibodies, and increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate  (ESR) . Four were diagnosed with Sjogren's syndrome (SS) . After surgery, the  patients were given the positron emission tomography computed tomography (PET-CT)  scans. All cases received \"watch and wait\" approach. Up to now, all cases showed  good prognoses and none of them relapsed. Conclusion: Primary thymic MALT lymphoma  was rare, and it was often associated with autoimmune diseases. Such patients who  usually had good prognoses should be followed up closely and avoided excessive  treatments if there were no indications of intervention."
